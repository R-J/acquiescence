# barryf-indieauth

barryf-indieauth is a very simple [IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/indieauth) authorization and token endpoint designed for my needs.

It requires a [Redis](https://redis.io/) server.

It's currently hardcoded to authorize using GitHub because that's my preferred provider, but adding in additional [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth)-compatible providers would be simple.
