# Acquiescence

Acquiescence is a very simple [IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/indieauth) authorization and token endpoint.

It requires a [Redis](https://redis.io/) server.

It's currently only set up to authorize using GitHub because that's my preferred provider, but adding in additional [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth)-compatible providers should be reasonably simple.
